In case of equal version priorities, the version string will be used to compute the order inside a group. If the version string is `kube-like`, it will sort above non `kube-like` version strings, which are ordered lexicographically. `Kube-like` versions start with a `v`, then are followed by a number (the major version), then optionally the string `alpha` or `beta` and another number (the minor version). These are sorted first by GA > `beta` > `alpha` (where GA is a version with no suffix such as `beta` or `alpha`), and then by comparing major version, then minor version. An example sorted list of versions: `v10`, `v2`, `v1`, `v11beta2`, `v10beta3`, `v3beta1`, `v12alpha1`, `v11alpha2`, `foo1`, `foo10`.
